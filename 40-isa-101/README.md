ISA 101
===

## Description

If you haven't tried our last year's ISA challenges, they are back this year with some changes here and there! 

This is a challenge to help you get along with the web interface debug environment, which combines as an debugger, an interpreter and challenge connections!

Check the [step by step guide](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/hkcert-ctf-2024-i-en-8381451153faac4a) to see how to use the frontend and explanation of what this really is! You will try out one of the hardcore reversing method: dealing with assembly and understand them directly!

Here is the [full documentation](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/bauhinia-isa) if you need more references.

Check out the ISH fullchain series after this!
