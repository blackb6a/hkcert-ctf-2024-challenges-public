ISH (3)
===

## Description

Shell(a.k.a sh) is a text-based interface where users can type commands to interact with the operating system. I'm trying to implement a shell using ISA, I call it ISH.

Note: This challenge is the last part of the ISH fullchain, read flag3.txt which presented in Dockerfile.

Note: ISH (1), ISH (2) and ISH (3) share the same environment, and it is recommended to solve the ISH fullchain challenges in order. 

Note: Here is the [full documentation](https://hackmd.io/@blackb6a/bauhinia-isa) and [ISA interpreter source code](https://github.com/blackb6a/ISA-Engine) if you need more references.
