## Description

Since 2020, Mystiz is well-known plagiarizing his own challenges.

This situation gets worse in 2024. He is now copying challenges from the [other CTFs](https://github.com/OfficialCyberSpace/CSCTF-2024/blob/main/crypto/mask-rsa/README.md). What's worse, the challenge author participates in this CTF!

Disclaimer: The challenge author didn't know I was going to copy his challenge.
